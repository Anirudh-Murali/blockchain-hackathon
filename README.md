> Blockchain-Integrated Electronic Health System

### Summary
An electronic health record system, built on blockchain. Transparent. Secure. Immutable.

NOTE: This repo is just for the back-end. Client-side code is [here](https://github.com/cktang88/blockchain-hackathon-client)

### The Need
Upon surveying many problems of the current healthcare system, we found that many of them exist due to the root cause of hospitals having a rigid, insecure health medical record that are built on technologies decades old. By solving this root problem, we hope to alleviate many other problems as well.

Currently, EHR systems in hospitals are problematic. They are hacked often (just google 'ehr systems hacked'), are not transparent, and don't keep a record of all changes to the patient record.

### Tech-stack
Hyperledger Composer, Fabric, and Playground for the blockchain, with jQuery+Bootstrap on the front.
